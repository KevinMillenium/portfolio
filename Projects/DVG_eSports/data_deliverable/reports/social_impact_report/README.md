# Socio-historical Context and Impact Report

### Socio-Historical Context ###
The biggest social issue surrounding Esports and our project (even though it¡¯s about performance and we don¡¯t think it has huge societal implications), is gender inequality. Men dominate the Esports industry, even though physical attributes are almost negligible for playing video games. More men play video games and male streamers have more fans and earn more than female players. More men are recruited by Esports teams and females who are recruited are paid much less. The Esports industry is big and only getting bigger, weighing in at about $950M in 2020 and expected to be $1.59B in 2023, but not everyone is getting a fair share. There is only 1 female Esports champion among the top 500 overall earners and the top male tournament earners earn about $3M more than the top female tournament earners. Outside of professional play, the top male streamers have about 1.5M more viewers than the top female streamers. Female gamers also frequently experience harassment and bullying because of their gender. In a survey of 388 female gamers, 57% admitted to experiencing harassment. 

Another rising issue in Esports is the growing racial gap. There are few African American and Latino players who go professional even though Esports fans are fairly evenly distributed by racial lines. A reason for this gap is that African American and Latino players prefer console gaming because of personal preference and because most of the time console gaming is cheaper than PC gaming. While there hasn¡¯t been substantial research on this topic, we think it¡¯s important to keep this in mind. Our game, League of Legends, is a lucrative PC game and it has few African American and Latino players, especially professional players. We should include with our research a recommendation for recruiters to actively recruit African American and Latino players, even if they don¡¯t fit the statistics. 

The major stakeholders in this project are ESports players, managers, and fans. We expect our research to be used by managers to recruit players with the statistics we find to predict a higher win rate. Our research will benefit those who have the statistics and hurt those who don¡¯t. For example, players with higher kills (if that¡¯s what we find) may be recruited more than players with less kills but higher statistics elsewhere. This has the potential to be dangerous because we know that any type of game has many different skills at play. A social-historical effect of this is that groups that are frequently excluded from Esports (e.g., women) may be excluded more and more. For example, if women on average have lower kills but higher assists, they may not be recruited. This may snowball into less and less women playing and getting into Esports. However, we may find a statistic that is high among women and that can actually decrease the gender inequality. In summary, the statistic our research may find as a big determinant of win rate will include groups that have that statistic and exclude those that don¡¯t. We need to make sure that the groups that shouldn¡¯t be excluded aren¡¯t excluded. And we should emphasize that statistics should be a factor in recruiting decisions, not the factor. Our research shouldn¡¯t affect the fans much. The way the game is played might change. For example, if managers recruit more players with higher kills, then games might have more action and offensive play. 

There is also a problem with toxicity  in the esports community.  Oftentimes, it is easier in the online environment to leave rash comments or preemptively say discouraging things to teammates or opponents.  Despite the digital nature of esports, online harassment has proven to serve real-world emotional and physical consequences for victims.  Part of the reason that this is a growing conversation is because the stakes of winning esports tournaments and having good performances gets exponentially higher year by year.  For example, in 2021 professional gamer Miranda Pakozdi quit her team after sexual harrassment from her coach.  However, there have been many instances where positive online communities exist.  Microsoft user experience designer Rebecca Chui found that ¡°anonmyous online communities are inherently toxic.¡±  Therefore, this suggests that a culture of online harassment requires community norms that allow for it in many cases. 


### Ethical Considerations ###
We¡¯ve covered most of the ethical and societal issues related to our data and analysis above. Because the data we¡¯re using for our project isn¡¯t survey or experimental data, but statistics tracked in-game, we don¡¯t think there¡¯s bias in our data collection. In-game statistics don¡¯t take into account a player¡¯s background. As explained above, the inequality behind the scenes in the composition of players who play and benefit from the game. The data is publicly available (players agreed when creating an account) and easily accessible (we¡¯re lucky) so we assume that we have permission to collect and analyze it. There will be challenges in the data life cycle, namely choosing a region and timeframe (we don¡¯t want to record statistics when a player first starts playing), but we¡¯re confident in the quality and cleanliness of our data.

One huge ethical consideration is how susceptible gamers can be picking up a gambling addiction.  Many games are set up and designed in a way that is supposed to draw the attention of gamers for many hours and some even implement a gambling aspect in the form of gaming items/tokens like loot boxes.  According to an article written by The Gamer, gambling among children in the UK rose from 0.4% in 2016 to 1.7% in 2018.  This increase could potentially be contributed from Loot Boxes that are found in some games.  There is a small chance at obtaining rare items, similarly to hitting a jackpot in many gambling games.  

We also talked about some of the potential misinterpretations in the prior question. We don¡¯t want our results to influence key decision makers so that they think the only thing that matters are the statistics we determine to be big predictors of win rate. There are a lot of factors that go into a player¡¯s success and a team¡¯s success (e.g., team chemistry, diversity, practice) and we don¡¯t want recruiters to search for numbers instead of the people who are behind those numbers, especially if those people are from underrepresented groups. As a team of data scientists who all enjoy playing video games in our freetime, we know that numbers don¡¯t say everything about the player you are.
